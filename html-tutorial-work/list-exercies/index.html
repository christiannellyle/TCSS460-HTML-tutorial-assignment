        <h1>Pibble's favorite hummus recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that Pibble has read over the years. </p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and dog treats. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
<li>175g of tahini</li>
<li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>Half a red pepper</li>
<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
<li>A dash of olive oil</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
<li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  <li>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
      </li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<li>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.
Experiment and see what works for you.</li>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. </p>
  
<p>You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it or else Pibble's belly will hurt.</p>

Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
